*Assembly, name=Assembly
** This defines the top-level model assembly block. All instances and constraints live here.
**  
*Instance, name=PART-1-1, part=PART-1
** This creates an instance named PART-1-1 from the part called PART-1.
** It brings the meshed part (defined elsewhere) into the global model.
** Material assignments
** Each *SOLID SECTION line maps an element set (EB1, EB2, EB3) to a material model.
** These element sets are defined in the mesh file (mesh.inp), inside the part PART-1.
*Solid Section, ELSET=EB1, MATERIAL=GRAYMATTER
*Solid Section, ELSET=EB2, MATERIAL=CSF
*Solid Section, ELSET=EB3, MATERIAL=SKULL
*End Instance

*Node
999999999, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
** This creates a single "manual" node at (0, 0, 0) with ID 999999999.
** It's not part of the mesh â€” it's a reference node for assigning the constraint.
**
*Nset, nset=REF
999999999,
** This defines a node set called REF that contains the reference node 999999999.
** This is used to apply constraints or boundary conditions to the rigid body.
**
*Rigid Body, ref node=REF, elset=PART-1-1.EB3
** This defines a rigid body constraint:
** - The reference node is REF (node 999999999).
** - The element set EB3 (inside instance PART-1-1) is the rigid body domain.
** All nodes in PART-1-1.EB3 will move rigidly, controlled by REF.
